# Contribution Guidelines for Webhooks Manager

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Webhooks Manager! We welcome new features that can enhance the project. Here are some rules and guidelines to follow:

1. **Search First**: Before proposing a new feature, search the existing issues to ensure you're not proposing a duplicate. If there's already an open discussion about the feature, join in.

2. **Open an Issue**: Before writing code, open a new issue in the project's repository. This lets the maintainers and the community discuss the feature, ensuring it aligns with the project's goals.

   - **Descriptive Title**: Your issue title should clearly indicate what the feature is about.
   - **Detailed Description**: Explain why the feature is needed, how it should work, and how it fits within the current project.
   - **Use Cases**: Provide scenarios where the feature would be beneficial.

3. **Wait for Approval**: Once the feature request is made, wait for the maintainers to approve, comment, or provide feedback on it. They might suggest changes, ask for clarifications, or decline the feature if it doesn't align with the project's objectives.

4. **Fork & Develop**: Once you've received the green light:

   - Fork the repository.
   - Create a new branch specific to your feature (e.g., `feature/new-widget`).
   - Write your code, adhering to the project's coding standards.
   - Ensure you've added necessary tests and documentation.

5. **Test Thoroughly**: Before submitting your contribution, ensure your feature works as expected and does not introduce new bugs. Also, run any existing tests to ensure they still pass.

6. **Commit Messages**: Your commit messages should be descriptive and follow any project standards. A general good rule is to format them like: "Add [feature name/details]".

7. **Update Documentation**: If your feature requires changes to the documentation or has specific nuances that future developers need to understand, ensure you update or add the necessary documentation.

8. **Pull Request (PR)**:

   - Submit a PR against the main project repository.
   - Provide a descriptive title and a comprehensive summary of the changes.
   - Link the PR to the feature request issue you initially opened.

9. **Review Process**:

   - The maintainers will review your PR. Be open to feedback and be prepared to make changes based on their reviews.
   - Address any comments or concerns raised by the maintainers.

10. **Merging**:

    - Once your PR is approved, the maintainers will merge it into the main project.
    - Celebrate your contribution!
